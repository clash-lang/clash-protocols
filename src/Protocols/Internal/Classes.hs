-- | A protocol describes the in- and outputs of one side of a 'Circuit'.
class Protocol a where
  -- | Sender to receiver type family. See 'Circuit' for an explanation on the
  -- existence of 'Fwd'.
  type Fwd (a :: Type)

  -- | Receiver to sender type family. See 'Circuit' for an explanation on the
  -- existence of 'Bwd'.
  type Bwd (a :: Type)

-- | A /Circuit/, in its most general form, corresponds to a component with two
-- pairs of an input and output. As a diagram:
--
-- @
--             Circuit a b
--
--            +-----------+
--     Fwd a  |           |  Fwd b
--   +------->+           +-------->
--            |           |
--            |           |
--     Bwd a  |           |  Bwd b
--   <--------+           +<-------+
--            |           |
--            +-----------+
-- @
--
-- The first pair, @(Fwd a, Bwd a)@ can be thought of the data sent to and from
-- the component on the left hand side of this circuit. For this pair, @Fwd a@
-- is the data sent from the circuit on the left hand side (not pictured), while
-- @Bwd a@ is the data sent to the left hand side from the current circuit.
--
-- Similarly, the second pair, @(Fwd b, Bwd)@, can be thought of as the data
-- sent to and from the right hand side of this circuit. In this case, @Fwd b@
-- is the data sent from the current circuit to the one on the right hand side,
-- while @Bwd b@ is the data received from the right hand side.
--
-- In Haskell terms, we would say this is simply a function taking two inputs,
-- @Fwd a@ and @Bwd b@, yielding a pair of outputs @Fwd b@ and @Bwd a@. This is
-- in fact exactly its definition:
--
-- @
--   newtype Circuit a b =
--     Circuit ( (Fwd a, Bwd b) -> (Bwd a, Fwd b) )
-- @
--
-- Note that the type parameters /a/ and /b/ don't directly correspond to the
-- types of the inputs and outputs of this function. Instead, the type families
-- @Fwd@ and @Bwd@ decide this. The type parameters can be thought of as
-- deciders for what /protocol/ the left hand side and right hand side must
-- speak.
--
-- Let's make it a bit more concrete by building such a protocol. For this
-- example, we'd like to build a protocol that sends data to a circuit, while
-- allowing the circuit to signal whether it processed the sent data or not. Similarly,
-- we'd like the sender to be able to indicate that it doesn't have any data to
-- send. These kind of protocols fall under the umbrella of "dataflow" protocols,
-- so lets call it /DataFlowSimple/ or /Df/ for short:
--
-- @
--   data Df (dom :: Domain) (a :: Type)
-- @
--
-- We're only going to use it on the type level, so we won't need any
-- constructors for this datatype. The first type parameter indicates the
-- synthesis domain the protocol will use. This is the same /dom/ as used in
-- /Signal dom a/. The second type indicates what data the protocol needs to
-- send. Again, this is similar to the /a/ in /Signal dom a/.
--
-- As said previously, we'd like the sender to either send /no data/ or
-- /some data/. We can capture this in a data type very similar to /Maybe/:
--
-- @
--   data Data a = NoData | Data a
-- @
--
-- On the way back, we'd like to either acknowledge or not acknowledge sent
-- data. Similar to /Bool/ we define:
--
-- @
--   newtype Ack = Ack Bool
-- @
--
-- With these three definitions we're ready to make an instance for /Fwd/ and
-- /Bwd/:
--
-- @
-- instance Protocol (Df dom a) where
--   type Fwd (Df dom a) = Signal dom (Data a)
--   type Bwd (Df dom a) = Signal dom Ack
-- @
--
-- Having defined all this, we can take a look at /Circuit/ once more: now
-- instantiated with our types. The following:
--
-- @
--   f :: Circuit (Df dom a) (Df dom b)
-- @
--
-- ..now corresponds to the following protocol:
--
-- @
--                            +-----------+
--       Signal dom (Data a)  |           |  Signal dom (Data b)
--  +------------------------>+           +------------------------->
--                            |           |
--                            |           |
--       Signal dom Ack       |           |  Signal dom Ack
--  <-------------------------+           +<------------------------+
--                            |           |
--                            +-----------+
-- @
--
-- There's a number of advantages over manually writing out these function
-- types:
--
--   1. It reduces syntactical noise in type signatures
--
--   2. It eliminates the need for manually routing acknowledgement lines
--
newtype Circuit a b =
  Circuit ( (Fwd a, Bwd b) -> (Bwd a, Fwd b) )
